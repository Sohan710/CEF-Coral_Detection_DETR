# CEF-Coral_Detection_DETR
In this project, we have detected the type of coral as Staghorn or Elkhorn using DETR, with the resultant images consisting of bounding boxes that convey the type of coral. However, the model was trained for 20 epochs. But DETR requires a much larger number of training epochs to converge than the existing object detectors.
